##Task Includes.
1. Set up a Git-Hub repo with different project title.
2. Create a blank HTML document.
3. Come up with a plan of web page( which section of the page should be grouped together ex., the navigation bar vs the video vs the side bar etc.).
4. Create empty semantic HTML elements to enclose those sections.
5. Use basic CSS to size and position them approximately on the page.
(Also use different background color for differentiating section's properly aslo use browser's developer tools)
6. Now let's start filling in these div's with content by creating Nav Bar.
7. Embed a YouTube video into your page.
8. Next, build the side bar section where previews of suggested videos show up.
(Obviously don't worry about generating these previews, just grap some thumbnail-sized images and plug in them in.)
9. Next, finish up by filling in some of the elements below the videos--
(the Title, Discription & number of views).
10. Push all solution's up to Git Hub.
